Cloud Annotations focuses on the dataset creation aspect of the model development life cycle leaving the training up to you. There are many ways to train your model, each with their own use cases and tradeoffs. You could train from scratch using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, use a drag & drop tool like Apple’s Create ML or use a cloud managed solution like Watson Machine Learning.
Today we’ll be using an online tool called Google Colab as a free and easy way to get our first model trained.



In order to access our training 
data from our Colab notebook, our code needs credentials for the object storage bucket. 
Paste the credentials copied from the previous step into the first cell and follow the 
rest of the instructions provided in the notebook.
