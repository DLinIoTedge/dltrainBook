# 1. Introduction
<div align="justify"> 
<p> 
 The Internet is designed to carry data by using IP packets across the network and deliver,  as per destination given its header segment. Challenge is to monitor above mentioned IP packets in a given enterprise  network and permit the same IP packet to travel to a defined destination mahine. 
 IP packets have few variations such as TCP, UDP and ICMP.  Moreover, mentioned IP packets need  to use PORTs in a given Machine to deliver.

<div align="justify"> 
<p> 
There have been events in which unwanted and harmful IP packets are used  to perform certain act in a remote machine.  Thus, there is a need to stop such IP packets in a given enterprise network and provide safety  to users of the internet in their enterprise. Volume of IP packets travels in a given enterprise network requires a huge amount of computing power to monitor IP packets and safeguard their user application.

### 3.2.1 TAP
<div align="justify"> 
<p> TAP devices provide a way to access the data flowing across a computer network, typically for the benefit of network security and performance monitoring tools. The monitored traffic is referred to as the “pass-through” traffic and the ports used for monitoring are called “monitor ports.” For a greater visibility into the network, a TAP can be placed between the router and the switch.
 </p>
 </div>



### 3.2.2 SPAN
<div align="justify"> 
<p> Port mirroring, also known as SPAN or roving analysis, is a method of monitoring network traffic that forwards a copy of each incoming and/or outgoing packet from one or more port (or VLAN) of a switch to another port where the network traffic analyzer is connected. SPAN is often used on simpler systems to monitor multiple stations at once  </p>
 </div>
   
 ### 3.3.3  Enterprise / Home  Router
 
 <div align="justify"> 
   <p>  
 Private IP addresses are known only for a small part of the devices on the Internet. For example, the IP address of your computer is known for your home router and, maybe, for your ISP too. Private IP addresses may overlap because they are used in internal networks. That’s why your friend and you may have the same IP addresses for your home routers. Since your IP address is not unique and publicly known, it seems that you can’t just send the information to a server across the Internet without having a public IP address, because the server won’t be able to send the reply to you. However, there’s a solution!.

 <div align="justify"> 
   <p>     
    When your ISP router receives a packet from you, it changes your private source IP address to its public IP address. Thus when a server gets the packet from you, it sends the reply to your ISP router, which changes the public destination IP address in the packet to your private IP address. For example, in the next scheme, the server doesn’t know how to reach the 192.168.100.5 IP address, but your ISP router knows and that’s why it does such changes with the IP addresses in packets:

## 3.3 Softwaare for Flow Collection

###  3.3.1 Wireshark 
<div align="justify"> 
<p>  Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network.  </p>
<p>  Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world. Like any other packet sniffer, Packet Capture, Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic – quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a tim  </p>

###  3.3.2 tcpdump 
<div align="justify"> 
<p> tcpdump is a network analysis tool—combining both power and simplicity into a single command-line interface  </p>
<p> Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match the boolean expression specified on the command line. It can also run with the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, or with the -r flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface  </p>

###  3.3.4  Scapy
<div align="justify"> 
<p>  
Scapy is a python package used to sniff, analyze, and send and receive arbitrary network packets. It comes with many of the common network layers built in. It can send packets at the "link layer", which means that even custom WiFi packets are possible (more on that later). With Scapy, nothing is hidden from you, all parts of the packets you send and receive are modifiable and can be inspected </p>
<p>  Scapy is a powerful and versatile tool that can replace most of the networking tools you're used to, like nmap, tcpdump, and traceroute. It allows you to experiment with low level networking code in a high level language. You can write servers, routers, firewalls, network tracing tools, and pretty much anything in Scapy, due to it's ability to sniff, send, and respond to packets. All of these properties make it very useful for network based attacks. </p>

 Maxwell Boltzmann statistics is applicable to identical,distinguishable particle of any type spin.The molecule of gas are particle of this type. </p>
<p>
Particles which are regulated by Maxwell-Boltzmann Statistics have to be distinguishable each other and one energy state can be occupied by two or more particles. Distinguishable means that if we have 2 particles, let say A and B, also two states, 1 and 2, and we put A to state 1 and B to state 2, it will be different with the distribution A to state 2 and B to state 1. It means that A and B are distinct

<p> Measurements of any kind, in any experiment, are always subject to uncertainties or errors, as they are  more often called. Measurement process is, in fact, a random process described by an abstract probability distribution whose parameters contain the information  desired. The results of a measurement are then samples from this distribution which allow an estimate of the theoretical parameters. In this view, measurement errors can be seen then as sampling errors.

<div align="justify"> 
<p>  Probability mass function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value </p>
<p> A probability mass function differs from a probability density function (PDF) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables. A PDF must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability.

The probability distribution of a random variable is a function that takes the sample space as input and returns probabilities: in other words, it maps possible outcomes to their probabilities. </p>
<p>  "Posterior", in this context, means after taking into account the relevant evidence related to the particular case being examined.

## 4.1 Restricted Boltzmann Machines

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58679469/150721702-1f34218d-a4ac-49cc-83d7-3802fb65dbc7.png">
</p>



Boltzmann machine:  Each undirected edge represents dependency. In this example there are 3 hidden units and 4 visible units. 

This is a restricted Boltzmann machine.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines are probabilistic. As opposed to assigning discrete values the model assigns probabilities. At each point in time the RBM is in a certain state. The state refers to the values of neurons in the visible and hidden layers v and h.



<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58679469/150721809-68974f08-992c-4a26-ae39-67401350a75a.png">
</p>


<div align="justify"> 
<p> This is the point where Restricted Boltzmann Machines meets Physics for the second time. The joint distribution is known in Physics as the Boltzmann Distribution which gives the probability that a particle can be observed in the state with the energy E. As in Physics we assign a probability to observe a state of v and h, that depends on the overall energy of the model. Unfortunately it is very difficult to calculate the joint probability due to the huge number of possible combination of v and h in the partition function Z. Much easier is the calculation of the conditional probabilities of state h given the state v and conditional probabilities of state v given the state h... .....and so on. the essential is here, energy-based probability  </p>
<p> 
Reconstruction is different from regression or classification in that it estimates the probability distribution of the original input instead of associating a continuous/discrete value to an input example.  </p>

 ## 4.2  Quantitative Risk assessment 


<div align="justify"> 
<p>  Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) whose nodes represent variables in the Bayesian sense: they may be observable quantities, latent variables, unknown parameters or hypotheses. Edges represent conditional dependencies; nodes that are not connected (no path connects one node to another) represent variables that are conditionally independent of each other. Each node is associated with a probability function that takes, as input, a particular set of values for the node's parent variables, and gives (as output) the probability (or probability distribution, if applicable) of the variable represented by the node. </p>
<p> Probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a directed acyclic graph (DAG)  </p>
 <p> Mostly this part is getting attraction in DL  </p>
<p> Gibbs sampling is applicable when the joint distribution is not known explicitly or is difficult to sample from directly, but the conditional distribution of each variable is known and is easy (or at least, easier) to sample from.  The Gibbs sampling algorithm generates an instance from the distribution of each variable in turn, conditional on the current values of the other variable. Gibbs sampling is particularly well-adapted to sampling the posterior distribution of a Bayesian network, since Bayesian networks are typically specified as a collection of conditional distributions.  Given an input vector v we are using p(h|v)  for prediction of the hidden values h. Knowing the hidden values we use p(v|h)for prediction of new input values v. This process is repeated k times. After k iterations we obtain an other input vector v_k which was recreated from original input values v_0  </p>
 </div>


<div align="justify"> 
<p>  This can be measured as the direct cost of the risk and indirect cost of the risk
 Mathematical representation of the risk in statistical terms gets very complex and is beyond the present scope of the paper. When using quantitative risk assessment looks logical, there some drawbacks of this approach in using for information systems. It’s easy to define the cost of the system, but the indirect costs are high, and the recovery cost is high and sometimes unknown. This quantitative risk is described mathematically as Annualized Loss of expectancy (ALE). The expected risk in terms of cost and loss in monetary terms can be expressed as the loss occurred due to risk over a year.
ALE=SLE* ARO
SLE (Single Loss Expectancy) is the value of a single loss of the asset. This may or may not be the entire asset. This is the impact of the loss. ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) is how often the loss occurs.   </p>
<p>  The quantitative risk assessment for information systems comes with a huge error margin as this method was not designed primarily for information systems in focus. Nowadays, there is a lot of improvement with new data processing and the high availability of data to use complex statistical processes to extrapolate and uncover hidden trends and risks. The statistical process also ensures that the quantitative risk assessment is repeatable and reproducible with the same consistency  </p>
 <p> 
The main reason for this is complexity in the identification and assigning of value to assets and limitations of statistical data, which helps in determining the frequency  </p>

 ## 4.3  Qualitative Risk assessment 
 <div align="justify"> 
 <p> 
 The inclusion of qualitative scales is especially useful when quantitative data for estimation of probabilities are lacking and experts are reluctant to express their opinions quantitatively. In reliability and risk analysis such situation occurs when for example human and organizational root causes of systems are modeled explicitly. Such causes are often not quantifiable due to limitations in the state of the art and lack of proper quantitative metrics
  </p>
<p>  Assumption in qualitative risk assessment is that there exists a high degree of uncertainty of impact values and likelihood that’s defined. Risk is subjective in terms of issues where the greater the difficulty in qualitative risk is in describing the likelihood and impact values. These values should be standard scaled so that it can be used with consistency across different risk assessment methods Some drawbacks of qualitative risk assessment are harder to communicate the results to management without precise information. Just saying the risk is high or low will not give a better understanding. To improve and overcome this hurdle, a table with impact and likelihood tables and the potential impact will assist the management in better handling the risk.  </p>

# 6. Data Set : PCAP file / Stream to Tensor


## 6.1 Read Packets from PCAP Stream

- Collect data from Netowrk and store it in PCAP File
- Process PCAP file as given in the following diagram to get Tensor
- Tensor is having time stamp column and Packet Data column


![NetworkSecurityLab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58679469/150686458-0f1f0f10-84d9-4580-a694-15644f2064ec.jpg)

 ## 6.2 Create Tensor from PCAP Packets
 If a new pcap record was populated successfully, the scalars are placed into respective tensor placeholders. The shape of the resulting output tensor is a matrix with two columns. One column holds the timestamp scalars for each read pcap packet. The other column holds the corresponding packet data as a string. Each row in the output tensor (matrix) corresponds to a pcap packet

# 8. Inference by using  Deep Learning Model

<div align="justify"> 
<p> Training platform is different from deployment platform. Same provides obstruction to carry trained network in to limited capability deployment edge. Mostly there is a need to cut down Model size or optimise weights of each node in Model. This mentioned optimisation of Model size of node weight may not be there if deployment happens in cloud side of infrastructure.   </p>

 <p><cite> Escalating actions: Russia has sent more than 100,000 soldiers to the nation's border with Ukraine. While no physical invasion has taken place yet, cyber operations are already underway. Earlier this month, hackers defaced dozens of government websites in Ukraine, a technically simple but attention-grabbing act that generated global headlines. More quietly, they also placed destructive malware inside Ukrainian government agencies. It’s not clear yet who is responsible, but Russia is the leading suspect    </p>

 Throughout 2021, we observed low  sophistication threat actors learn that they  could create big impacts in the operational  technology (OT) space—perhaps even bigger than they intended. Actors will continue to  explore the OT space in 2022 and increasingly use ransomware in their attacks. This targeting  will occur because of the need to keep OT environments fully operational, especially when the systems are part of critical infrastructure. Attacks against critical OT environments can cause serious disruption and even threaten human lives, thereby increasing the pressure for organizations to pay a ransom. To compound the issue, many of these OT devices are not built with security at the forefront of the design, and we’re currently seeing a massive uptick in the number of vulnerabilities being identified in OT environments
