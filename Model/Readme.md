# 1. Design Deep Learning Model

# 2. Train Deep Learning Model

## 2.1 Use DLtrain AI Platform
[click](https://github.com/DLinIoTedge/dltrainBook/tree/jk/DLtrain) to access training workflow for  NN and CNN model in DLtrain

## 2.2 Use TensorFlow AI Platform

### 2.2.1 Train given Pre-trained Model
[click](https://github.com/DLinIoTedge/dltrainBook/tree/jk/Data-Set/DataForPretrainedModel) to access training workflow for a given
pre-trained model

### 2.2.2 Train CNN Model with Local Data Set storage

[click](https://github.com/DLinIoTedge/dltrainBook/tree/jk/Data-Set/PotatoNode) to access trining workflow for a given CNN model and Local Data Set (potato )

[click](https://github.com/DLinIoTedge/dltrainBook/tree/jk/Data-Set/mnist4fileAndNPZ) to access trining workflow for a given CNN model and Local Data Set (MNIST Hand written digits data set )

## 2.3 Use PyTorch AI Platform




# 3. Save Deep Learning Model

# 4. Load Deep learning Model
